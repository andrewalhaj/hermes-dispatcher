kanban_export.py — snapshot the kanban board to a static JSON the wall-dash
Projects tab can fetch. Read-only against kanban.db; pushes to the HA box.

WHY: kanban.db lives on the worker box; the dashboard is nginx on the HA box
with no path to a cross-host DB. This bridges them with a static file — the
fail-safe choice (stale data beats a broken dashboard, no new service).

OUTPUT shape (kanban-state.json):
  {
    "generated_at": <unix>, "generated_iso": "...",
    "boards": [
      {"slug","name","counts":{status:n},
       "tasks":[{"id","title","status","assignee","priority","created_at",
                 "completed_at"}]}
    ],
    "totals": {status: n}
  }

Tasks are capped + ordered (active first, then recent) so the file stays small.
Run from cron every few minutes. Silent on success unless --verbose.

BOARD ROUTING
Tasks are routed to named boards by title prefix (case-insensitive).
Boards are always emitted in BOARD_ORDER, even if empty (so the dropdown
shows all boards regardless of whether they have tasks yet).
