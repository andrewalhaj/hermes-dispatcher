# heal-skill-descriptions.sh — on_session_start hook.
#
# Purpose: a core `hermes update` overwrites /usr/local/lib/hermes-agent/skills
# and re-introduces >60-char skill descriptions (the trigger-surface cliff).
# This guard re-heals them on the first session after any update, then stays
# silent and near-zero-cost on every subsequent session (nothing to do).
#
# Wire protocol: receives a JSON payload on stdin (ignored), prints nothing
# (silent no-op) unless it heals, in which case it emits a {"context": ...}
# note so the session knows reconciliation happened. Exit 0 always — a hook
# must never block session start.

# Fast guard: exit 0 immediately if nothing is truncated (the common case).

# Something is truncated (likely a post-update wipe) — heal it.

# Emit a context note (valid JSON) so the session is aware; never block.
