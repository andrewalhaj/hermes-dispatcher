"""Staleness audit scan — deterministic dead-term flagging over the LanceDB cold
store + ~/.hermes/references/ docs. READ-ONLY: prints a flag report, mutates nothing.

This is STEP 1 of the staleness-audit methodology (see SKILL.md). Output is a
FLAG list, NOT a kill list — every hit must still be classified by hand into
CORRECT / KEEP-historical / PROTECT-meta / REINGEST, and the dead-term premise
must be verified against the LIVE filesystem before acting (steps 2-4 in SKILL.md).

USAGE:
    1. Edit the DEAD list below for the CURRENT verified-dead facts (this is the
       one part you must keep current — it encodes "what is no longer true").
    2. python3 scripts/staleness_scan.py
    3. Manually verify each dead term is ACTUALLY dead on the live host (docker ps,
       port probe, ls) before trusting the flags.
    4. Classify flags into the four buckets; write the ledger to
       references/staleness-audit-<date>.md.

Suppresses the HF/torch load-weights noise so the report is clean.
